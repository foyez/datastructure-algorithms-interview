# Dynamic Programming
* It's an optimization technique of caching the sub problem which is repeated in a problem.

`Dynamic Programming = Divide & Conquer + Memoization (Caching)`

## Apply Dynamic Programming in a problem
1. Can be divided into subproblem
2. Recursive solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblem?
